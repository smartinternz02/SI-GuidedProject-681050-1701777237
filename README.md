**A Greener Tomorrow: Machine Learning in Soil Moisture Prediction**

**Overview**
"A Greener Tomorrow" is a machine learning project designed to predict soil moisture levels for sustainable agricultural practices. This initiative leverages historical and real-time data to optimize irrigation decisions, conserve water resources, and promote environmental sustainability.

**Dataset**
The dataset utilized for this project includes the following key features:

Month
day
average-temperature
average-humidity

**Project Structure**
The project is structured as follows:

**dataset/**: Contains dataset, including historical weather and soil moisture data, and real-time weather and irrigation data.
**app.py/**: Python script for deploying the trained soil moisture prediction model.
**README.md**: Project overview, dependencies, structure, and instructions.
**requirements.txt**: List of project dependencies.

**Project Objectives**
_Optimize Irrigation Practices:_

Utilize machine learning models to predict soil moisture levels, enabling farmers to optimize irrigation practices and minimize water usage.
_Increase Agricultural Efficiency:_

Provide accurate and timely predictions for soil moisture, allowing farmers to make informed decisions, leading to increased agricultural efficiency and productivity.
_Promote Sustainable Agriculture:_

Contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing water wastage, energy consumption, and the environmental impact associated with improper irrigation.

**Dependencies**
_Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the project:
_

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Project Usage
